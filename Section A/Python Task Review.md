# Correctness
Line 2,3,4,5,6,8,10: The indentations of these lines are incorrect.
Line 2: The initialization of the result array is incorrect.
Line 5: No argument is being passed to the functions.
Line 6: This conditional statement will return false as result is an empty array.An error will occur as result[x] does not refer to the index in the result array.
Line 9: An error will occur as result[x] does not refer to the index in the result array.
Line 10: Python arrays do not have a .value() method and will return an error

The for loop will add each element to the result array without grouping the anagrams together.

# Efficiency
The groupAnagrams function has an average performance O(N). The performance will decrease as the input array size increases.

# Style
The indentation of the lines are inconsistent and will cause errors when the code is being compiled.

# Documentation
There are no comments explaining what the code is doing or what the purpose of the code is.

# Positive aspects and improvements
This submission is a good attempt to solve the problem. It shows that you have the correct theory in place to solve the problem. With the corrections above and a small adjustment in your logic you should be able to solve the problem quite well.

I recommend refreshing your knowledge on the indentations in Python and list/array manipulation. Remember that you can always break the problem up into smaller pieces to help you solve the problem. Once you are happy with each small element combine each element together to match the requirements in the task.

I look forward to your next submission!
